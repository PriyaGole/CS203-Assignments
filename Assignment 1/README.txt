The Libraries used in the program are as follows:
* Numpy
* Matplotlib 
* Scipy
* Pandas 

How to run the program:
* Install the libraries mentioned above.
* To run in terminal: Go to the directory containing the .py file and run
  the following command: python 200727_Q4.py. 
  Here, it is assumed that the default python version is python3. 
  If the default python is python2, run this instead: python3 200449 Q4.py
* To run using IDE: Open the file in any desired IDE that supports python and run the code.  

Input Format:
* Input m: Input any natural number 'm' (The random variable takes the value 0, 1, ..., m-1)
* Input the respective probabilities p_0, p_2, ..., p_{m-2}. 
* Input n: Input any natural number 'n' (number of random samples to be generated)

Expected Output:
* For iterations itr(= 50000), the samples and their average are printed in the terminal.
* The graph of frequency vs. average is plotted, and then a smoothened curve is also plotted.
