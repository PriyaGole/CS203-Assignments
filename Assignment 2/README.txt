The Libraries used in the program are as follows:
* Numpy
* Matplotlib 
* Random 

How to run the program:
* Install the libraries mentioned above.
* To run in terminal: Go to the directory containing the .py file and run
  the following command: python 200727_Q2.py. 
  Here, it is assumed that the default python version is python3. 
  If the default python is python2, run this instead: python3 200449 Q4.py
* To run using IDE: Open the file in any desired IDE that supports python and run the code.  

Expected Output:
* Prediction for 3 different N's.

* Prediction 1

* For k going from 1 to 1000, corresponding expected N values 
  (calculated using mean, on 100 iterations) are as follows:
  **displayes the array of 1000 expected N

* For k going from 1 to 1000, corresponding expected N values 
  (calculated using median, on 100 iterations) are as follows:
  **displayes the array of 1000 expected N

*The actual value of N is ____**(displays the actual value)

*Graph of k vs expected_N calculated using mean.
*Graph of k vs expected_N calculated using median.

**Similarly for Prediction 2 and 3
